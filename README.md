* Able to serve UDP and TCP requests in parallel within one instance
* Low-memory footprint and optimized usage of memory
* Real-time requests' elaboration using parallel thread pools and queues
* High availability and reactivity using event-driven pattern.
* High security and stability provided by decoupling the engine core from customized protocol-related executions using a full modular pattern implementation.
* Advanced garbage collector with a minimal impact on the server load
* Notification-driven pattern to interact with requests and get actions
* Integrity checks performed on requests avoiding useless cpu-time and memory consumption
* Memory-slot support to reduce I/O from a storage available for both UDP and TCP
* File Upload capability 
* (<b>NEW</b>) Enable/Disable TLS support for server/client nodes
* Support for temporary or permanent connections
* Support for hot-load plugins (add/replace/remove commands) without restarting a server

It provides a professional embedded server (on client side) with these features:

* Embedded server on TCP protocol
* Able to send UDP and TCP requests
* Asynchronous and synchronous requests
* File upload capability
